Foundation SASS
===============

To create your first project, you'll need to have foundation-sass installed. Foundation SASS will also install the dependencies it needs to work properly.

To install from Ruby Gems   
-------------------------

In Terminal:

* sudo gem install foundation-sass

To install locally
------------------

In Terminal:

* git clone git://github.com/bzerangue/foundation-sass.git
* cd foundation-sass
* sudo gem build foundation-sass.gemspec
* sudo gem install foundation-sass-2.1.gem

To create your first project
----------------------------

* cd path/to/where-you-want-new-project
* .scss syntax
* `compass create my_project -r foundation-sass --using foundation-sass`
* .sass syntax
* `compass create my_project -r foundation-sass --using foundation-sass --syntax sass`
    
Now you should have a new project folder created with the foundation file structure, but with the awesome advantages of having all the css pre-processed with Sass.
