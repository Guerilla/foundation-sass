Foundation SASS
===============

To create your first project, navigate to the foundation-sass folder in terminal and install the gem. You'll also need to make sure Compass is installed.
    
In Terminal:

* sudo gem install compass
* sudo gem install foundation-sass

Next you'll create your first project.

In Terminal:

* cd path/to/where-you-want-new-project
* compass create my_project -r foundation-sass --using foundation-sass --force
    
Now you should have a new project folder created with the foundation file structure, but with the awesome advantages of having all the css pre-processed with Sass.
